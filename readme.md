# Project "On A Shoestring Around Europe"

## HTML and CSS were used in the project which was accomplished within the course Web Development

The website demonstrates most of the HTML tags, ability to create a responsive design with an opportunity to choose day/night mode. 
It also includes a form (to submit an email).
Some JavaScript is used to improve user experience. 

The design may not be the best :)
