                <p>
                    The city of love and romance Paris! As we used a low-cost airline, our plane landed at Paris
                    Beauvais
                    Aiport
                    (<span lang="fr">Rte de l'Aéroport</span>, 60000 <span lang="fr">Tillé</span>, France), which is
                    located not really closed to the very Paris. The bus
                    to the
                    city
                    center
                    was quite expensive, but we didn’t have another choice at this point. All the expenses will be

                    <h2>I. Itinerary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our trip to Paris was planned to see all the landmarks within 24 hours (not a joke, we came at 4
                        pm
                        and
                        had
                        to leave
                        at 4 pm of the following day) and we intended to execute the plan. If you haven’t decided yet
                        whether
                        you
                        want to go
                        to Paris or not, watch this short video and the croissant will definitely persuade you.
                        As stated before, we had only 24 hours to see everything and everyone in this huge city. Let's
                        get
                        down
                        to
                        business
                        without postponing.

                    <h3>1. <span lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        Right after the airport, we took the bus to <span lang="fr">Porte Maillot</span> and from there
                        headed to the
                        <span lang="fr">
                            Arc de
                            Triomphe.
                        </span> The
                        <span lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile</span> is one of the most famous monuments in
                        Paris
                        and
                        the most
                        famous such arch in the world. It is located on <span lang="fr">Place Charles de Gaulle</span>,
                        formerly called <span lang="fr">Place de l'Étoile</span>,
                        preserved only in the name of the arch. This is the northwest of the city, at the end of the
                        <span lang="fr">Champs Élysées</span>.
                        The <span lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</span> was created in honor of all those who fought and died
                        for France during the
                        French
                        Revolution
                        and the Napoleonic Wars. The name of all the places where the French won, as well as the French
                        generals
                        of
                        that
                        time, are written on the outer and inner surface of the arch. Under its arches, there is the
                        tomb of
                        the
                        Unknown
                        Soldier from the First World War.

                    <h3>2. Eiffel Tower</h3>
                    <p>
                        Then we headed to the Eiffel Tower, the symbol of Paris. Do you know that it’s the most visited
                        and the
                        most
                        useless
                        landmark in the world? No, really, it has no specific aim but visiting it and its merchandise
                        are doing great
                        business
                        for the
                        city and country. It was a must-visit point for us to take pictures nearby in the daylight and
                        show
                        off
                        on
                        the
                        Instagram, of course. We headed from <span lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> to Eiffel Tower, went
                        round the Tower, took A
                        LOT
                        of
                        pictures of it
                        and with it and headed to <span lang="fr">Trocadéro</span>. I think it was the best place to
                        take pictures with Eiffel
                        Tower from.
                        We
                        spent a
                        whole hour there and took a walk on the embankment to the side of the next point in the list.

                        lanterns and sculptures, is rightfully considered one of the most beautiful bridges in Paris.

                    <h3>4. <span lang="fr">Place de la Concorde</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        <span lang="fr">Place de la Concorde</span> is a truly vast square, an outstanding monument of
                        urban planning of the
                        classicism
                        era. The
                        decision to base the square was made by <span lang="fr">Louis</span> XV in 1775 and entrusted
                        to the architect
                        Gabriel.
                        Initially, the square was an octagon surrounded by a moat, at the corners of which eight
                        allegorical
                        statues stood,
                        symbolizing the main cities of France. In the middle was an equestrian statue of <span
                            lang="fr">Louis</span> XV by
                        <span lang="fr">Bouchardon</span>
                        and
                        <span lang="fr">Pigalle</span>.
                        On the north side, the elegant buildings of the Naval Ministry and the <span lang="fr">Hotel de
                            Crillon</span> were
                        erected.
                        <span lang="fr">Place de la Concorde</span> is one of the most beautiful places in Paris. But
                        there is something
                        that
                        makes it
                        different. From any point of the square, a beautiful view of Paris opens up, it is not built up
                        around
                        the
                        perimeter
                        with houses - that's what makes it special.

                        Museum (<span lang="fr">Rue de Rivoli</span>, 75001 Paris, France). And yet... imagine 22
                        football fields at once; fill
                        this
                        space
                        with
                        tens of thousands of sculptures, paintings, jewelry, ceramics and decor - everything that
                        mankind
                        has
                        produced over
                        the past 5 thousand years; imagine that every day two infantry divisions (25-30 thousand people)
                        march
                        through this
                        territory. So this is the Louvre. What you should also know is that there is not entrance fee
                        for
                        student.
                        Amazing,
                        right? But we didn't go there. We had only 24 hours to see all Paris. Only visiting Louvre
                        would
                        take
                        24 hours (or even more),
                        actually.

                        <span lang="fr">Les Halles</span> is geographically located in the heart of Paris. It got its
                        name from the huge
                        market,
                        which,
                        even before
                        the second half of the 20th century, occupied several square kilometers of its territory. Only
                        in
                        the
                        70s it
                        was
                        decided to demolish the buildings of the old market and equip a park in its place. Actually,
                        it’s
                        just a
                        huge mall.
                        So, visit it if you have free time.

                    <h3>9. <span lang="fr">Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        The construction of the <span lang="fr">Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris</span> lasted for almost
                        two centuries, which,
                        however,
                        only
                        benefited it. At the time of laying the first stone, French architecture was dominated by the
                        Romanesque
                        style,
                        which was replaced by the Gothic during the construction process. The cathedral absorbed the
                        best of
                        both,
                        resulting in its own unique look.
                        It was assumed that the cathedral would be so large that it could accommodate all the
                        inhabitants of
                        Paris,
                        that at
                        that time numbered about ten thousand.
                        Another design feature of the cathedral is that it does not have any internal walls. They are
                        replaced
                        by
                        columns
                        connected by arches, and the rooms are separated from each other by stained-glass windows.
                        It is believed that one of the nails with which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
                        was
                        knocked
                        together
                        is kept in the cathedral.</p>
                    <p>The first part of the trip is ending here. If you have enough energy, you can also go to
                        Eiffel
                        Tower to see it in the lights and take more pictures.</p>

                    <p>
                        We visited the next two points on the following day. Without haste, we went to <span

                        was
                        originally
                        designed as a church, but later turned into a temple.
                        <span lang="fr">Panthéon</span> is located at the top of Mount <span
                            lang="fr">Saint-Geneviève</span>, near the Sorbonne University and the

                        Gardens,
                        directed towards the Latin Quarter. Back in 507, this place was chosen by King Clovis for the
                        basilica
                        as a
                        tomb for
                        him and his wife Clotilde. In 512, <span lang="fr">Sainte-Geneviève</span>, the patron saint of
                        Paris, was buried here.

                    <p>
                        We tasted some local pastry and headed to <span lang="fr">Sacré-Cœur</span>.
                        Literally,
                        the
                        name
                        of the
                        basilica is translated from French as "Holy Heart". <span lang="fr">Sacré-Cœur</span> is located
                        on top of the
                        Montmartre

                        the
                        highest

                    <h2>II. Tips and features</h2>
                    <p>
                        Well, I definitely can recommend "<span lang="fr">Le Petit Bouillon Vavin</span>"" (119 <span
                            lang="fr">Bd du Montparnasse</span>, 75006 Paris,
                        France).
                        We
                        had a
                        delicious dinner there and it was quite cheap. Probably, you will see a line on the street, but
                        the
                        line
                        moves fast.
                        It's worth waiting! </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, keep all your documents, phones, and money in the inner pockets. I’m not sure whether this
                        stereotype
                        about
                        pickpockets in Paris is true, or I was lucky enough, but someone stole my electric toothbrush
                        from my
                        backpack (who
                        needs it, though?).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you watched “Emily in Paris”, probably you would be eager to visit the restaurant from the
                        series.
                        It’s
                        “<span lang="it">Terra Nera</span>” (18 <span lang="fr">Rue des Fossés Saint-Jacques</span>,
                        75005 Paris, France), looks quite authentic and
                        interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you watched “Miraculous: Tales Of Ladybug & Cat Noir”, you would probably like to visit the
                        bakery
                        from
                        the
                        cartoon. It’s “<span lang="fr">Boris Lumé Boulangerie</span>” (48 <span lang="fr">Rue
                            Caulaincourt</span>, 75018 Paris, France). The famous
                        bakery
                        looks
                        exactly
                        like in the cartoon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don’t forget to try the local pastry! It’s soooo good and cheap enough.
                        By the way, we took a lunch box with different salami and cheese. So, we did not have to spend
                        money
                        on
                        the
                        lunch.
                        Paris itself is quite expensive, and I hope you will be able to save some money in your trip!

                    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for reading it till the very end. Is Paris overrated? Maybe. Is it still good?
                        Definitely,
                        yes.
                        Pastry,
                        architecture, and the French language – what I like about this trip. Also, note that all the
                        expenses
                        should
                        be
                        divided by 2, as it’s for 2 people. I hope you will enjoy Paris. Mind your pocket! :)
