                <p>
                    Surely, accommodation is very important. However, remember that you will not spend too much time
                    in it.
                    You will come to the new location to see new things (outside), not someone’s property.

                <h2>Booking</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.booking.com/" target="_blank">Booking: </a>find great hotel or apartment deals
                    and book in just a few minutes. Just put your destination,
                    dates,
                    and number of
                    guests, filter the price range, and find the best option for yourself. For most offers,
                    the
                    free
                    cancelation is available (till the very date of the arrival or a bit earlier).
                    All the options have detailed descriptions and list of what is provided and not provided. Don't
                    forget
                    to check the
                    reviews! You will find a lot of useful information there.
                    Once you book an accommodation, you will be able to chat directly with the property in the app or on
                    the
                    website to
                    clarify all your questions and concerns.
                    Booking also has a flexible system of discounts for regular customers.
                    Personally, I use Booking to search for cheap hostels. The significant point for me is the provision
                    of
                    the towel,
                    as I usually don't bring mine (because I travel only with a backpack which can't accommodate a lot).
                    If
                    the hostel
                    provides breakfast, it's also good and lucky but not a must-be point.

                <h2>Airbnb</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb: </a>millions of Hosts on Airbnb invite
                    people from everywhere to live, work, and rest.
                    The concept of Airbnb is that people rent out their apartments, houses, rooms. Despite this, you
                    will
                    see some
                    variants of hostels and hotels as well.
                    What I love about Airbnb is the ability to directly contact the owner of the property. Most of them
                    reply quite fast
                    and are eager to help you.
                    No fraud can go through the process of verification, so there is nothing to be worried about.
                    Put your destinations, dates, and number of guests and search for the most suitable variant for you.
                    Once you press
                    "reserve" to reserve the accommodation, your reservation also must be approved by the owner of the
                    property. This
                    process takes not more than 24 hours. If the reservation is not approved within this time frame,
                    it's
                    automatically
                    canceled.
                    Personally, I use it to search for not the hostels or hotels, but apartments or rooms. I find this
                    option a bit more
                    expensive than Booking, so it's more suitable if you travel with a friend or even some friends.

                <h2>Couchsurfing</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/" target="_blank">CouchSurfing: </a>you have friends around
                    the world, you just haven’t met them yet. Couchsurfing is the best way to
                    stay
                    with locals,
                    make lifelong travel friends, or host travelers coming to your hometown. It's not just a phrase.
                    Browse the millions of local hosts offering a place to stay in thousands of cities around the globe.
                    And
                    yes,
                    completely free.
                    Please, note Couchsurfing is not only about accommodation. It's about useful networking. If you take
                    something, give
                    something back. If someone hosts you in their city, let someone else sleep over at yours in your
                    city or
                    bring
                    something (related specifically to your departure country).
                    You can use Couchsurfing to search for not only accommodation but people who are nearby and ready to
                    hang out with
                    you if you travel alone (and feel lonely).
                    Don't be shy, ask whatever you are curious or worried about, specify all the features and
                    requirements
                    of the host.
                    Some people will be eager to show you the city, some will just let you stay even without talking to
                    you.
                    Some people
                    prefer being naked in their house, some people don't. All people are different, remember it and
                    specify
                    all these
                    details before your arrival.
                    To be honest, I used Couchsurfing only once. But I have friends who use it regularly, save a lot of
                    money by that,
                    and at the same time make new friends around the world. My first experience was amazing, and I
                    definitely will use
                    Couchsurfing again.

                <h2>Epilogue</h2>
                <p>
                    A small tip: rely on the reviews. These people were in your shoes and went through the same
                    experience.
                    They can
                    tell you all the advantages and disadvantages of the specific place to stay. Of course, any
                    accommodation can and
                    will have negative reviews because people tend to leave their negative emotions. Just consider all
                    the
                    pros and cons
                    and make your decision relying on that. (E.g., if the description of the hostel says that they
                    provide
                    breakfast and
                    you see some reviews that it’s not true indeed and it was an important point for you, think twice
                    before
                    making your
                    choice).
