                <h1>Berlin, Germany</h1>
                <p>
                    Visiting Germany, and especially Berlin, has been my dream since I was 14 years old. I was
                    learning
                    German
                    at school
                    and at university. It’s been the time to practice it in real life! How come I bought the tickets
                    and
                    went
                    there?
                    Completely by accident, I decided to check the prices for the tickets, and they cost €20.
                    Obviously, I
                    could
                    not
                    resist the temptation. Watch this short video and let’s start out trip.

                    <p>
                        It was my first solo trip. Also, my first CouchSurfing experience happened in Berlin. I spent
                        there
                        almost 4
                        days
                        and had enough time to enjoy the city not only outside but in different museums and I even
                        visited
                        <span lang="de">Reichstag</span>.

                    <p>
                        If you expect to see the attributes of ancient Europe on the central square, then your
                        expectations
                        will
                        not
                        come
                        true. Today <span lang="de">Alexanderplatz</span>, named after the visit of the Russian emperor
                        Alexander I (1805), is
                        a
                        typically
                        modern
                        square. The 20th century almost completely changed the historical site, increasing its size by 4
                        times.
                        The
                        vast
                        space impresses with its size and scale of grandiose structures.
                        Today, <span lang="de">Alexanderplatz</span> symbolizes the economic power and cultural
                        prosperity of the German

                        <span lang="de">Alexanderplatz</span> is
                        a favorite meeting place for Berliners, a solid transport interchange and a popular tourist

                    <h3>2. <span lang="de">Berliner Fernsehturm</span> (Berlin TV tower)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The unique high-rise building, erected back in socialist Germany, has not lost its futuristic
                        symbolism
                        even
                        today.
                        The Berlin TV Tower (height 368 m) still looks like an object of architectural modernism.
                        The result of the collective labor justified the expense - a masterpiece of high-rise
                        construction
                        is
                        still
                        a
                        popular tourist attraction. At a height of 200 meters, there is a huge metal ball with a
                        diameter of
                        32
                        meters.
                        Several entrances to the tower let hundreds of tourists pass every day, ascending in swift
                        silent
                        elevators
                        to the
                        observation deck in almost seconds. It is located inside the ball at an altitude of 204 m, where
                        there
                        is a
                        charming
                        panorama of the city. There is also a wonderful restaurant with national German cuisine.
                        However,
                        the
                        prices
                        there
                        are too high for us, so, let’s skip this part.

                    <h3>3. St. Mary's Church</h3>
                    <p>
                        Among the modern buildings on the Alexanderplatz, there is the "island" of antiquity - the
                        Church of
                        St.
                        Mary. Its
                        Baroque-Gothic appearance is a reminder of the historical past. It captivates with its
                        authenticity.
                        Built
                        in the
                        13th century of bright red brick in the Brandenburg Gothic style, the church has undergone
                        changes
                        in
                        architecture.
                        After a fire in the 17th century that damaged the tower, it was restored and decorated with
                        baroque
                        elements. And in
                        the 18th century, the tower got a neo-Gothic look. The Church of St. Mary remained the only old
                        building
                        on
                        the
                        square. The temple has become a kind of museum where you can see the true atmosphere of the
                        Middle
                        Ages.

                    <h3>4. Fountain Neptune</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not far from the TV tower, there is a masterpiece of fountain architecture of the 19th century -
                        the
                        Neptune
                        Fountain. It belongs to the main attractions and serves as a symbol of the rebirth not only of
                        Berlin,
                        but
                        of the
                        whole of Germany.
                        Like many architectural monuments of the city, the fountain-monument was significantly damaged
                        during
                        the
                        bombing of
                        1945. Unique cast sculptures were restored to their original form, and the monument was
                        installed in
                        a
                        new
                        location
                        - next to <span lang="de">Alexanderplatz</span>. The fountain is impressive in its dimensions.

                    <p>
                        The unusually bright and beautiful building of the Red Town Hall strikes the imagination with
                        its
                        strict
                        and
                        at the
                        same time pompous architecture. In its external appearance, 2 styles were mixed - Renaissance
                        and
                        Neo-Gothic, which
                        gave the building a majestic look.
                        Today, almost all official meetings and business meetings are held in the Column and Armorial

                        The oldest church (beginning of the 13th century) adorns the historical quarter of the city with
                        the
                        same
                        name. It
                        was erected near the crossing of the river. Later it was rebuilt, giving the appearance of a
                        gothic
                        hall
                        church with
                        a richly decorated altar and a tower at the top.
                        In 1938, the historical and religious-architectural monument became state property.
                        Despite the brutal bombardments of 1945, the powerful walls of the sanctuary withstood, but the
                        church
                        stood
                        in a
                        dilapidated form for a long time. Now a branch of the Brandenburg Museum with artifacts from the
                        13th-14th
                        centuries
                        is organized here.

                    <h3>7. <span lang="de">Berliner Dom</span> (Berlin Cathedral)</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the museum island, there is the famous Berlin Cathedral - the largest Protestant church in
                        Germany.
                        The
                        baroque
                        appearance of the Protestant church, bright and lush, is devoid of traditional asceticism.
                        After the end of the war, the cathedral had been reconstructed for many years. As a result, it
                        has
                        decreased
                        in
                        height by 6m, but still impresses with its irresistible beauty. An observation deck is located
                        in
                        the
                        central dome,
                        where tourists often go. The organ of the famous master Sauer is installed in the hall.

                    <p>
                        It’s a huge island with a lot of different islands. Even though I’ve been there for almost 4
                        days, I
                        did
                        not
                        have
                        enough time to visit them. You will find there the <span lang="de">Altes Museum</span> (Old
                        Museum), the <span lang="de">Neues Museum</span>
                        (New
                        Museum),
                        the
                        <span lang="de">Alte Nationalgalerie</span> (Old National Gallery), the Bode Museum, the
                        Pergamon Museum, the Humboldt
                        Forum.
                        Personally, I did not visit any of them, but I visited the Pergamon Museum: Panorama. It’s not
                        on
                        the
                        island
                        but
                        nearby.

                        It is impossible not to notice the beauty of <span lang="de">Unter den Linden</span>. The
                        street, which is 1,390 meters
                        long,
                        got
                        its name
                        from the lindens that grow along the alley (<span lang="de">Unter den Linden</span> - under the
                        lindens).
                        <span lang="de">Unter den Linden</span> has buildings of different eras and architecture, the
                        Embassy of the Russian
                        Federation,
                        the US

                        Lustgarten Park
                        and much more.
                        To be honest, I added this point because we were told about this street in German classes at my
                        first
                        university,
                        where I studied the German language. It was nice to see this street in real life.

                    <p>
                        <span lang="de">Bebelplatz</span> became famous after the tragic events in 1933, when about 20
                        thousand books were
                        burned,
                        which
                        were
                        considered "anti-German". Today, in this very place, you can observe a monument dedicated to
                        fatal
                        actions -
                        a glass
                        window that goes deep into the ground, where there are empty bookshelves.
                        In addition to the monument on <span lang="de">Bebelplatz</span>, there are a library and the
                        Humboldt University, the
                        German
                        State

                        The

                    <p>
                        In the very heart of Berlin, there is a monumental, majestic building that survived the
                        victorious
                        procession of
                        triumph and the inglorious defeat of fascism. The architectural and historical monument is a
                        significant
                        symbol not
                        only of Berlin, but of the whole of Germany. For 10 years, a grandiose building was erected,
                        intended
                        for a
                        meeting
                        of the German parliament - the Reichstag, now the Bundestag.
                        The monumental beauty of the Reichstag after a major restoration again fascinates and delights
                        tourists
                        who
                        actively
                        visit the German Parliament.
                        An attractive factor is the presence of a glass dome at the top, in which an observation deck is
                        located
                        (height 40
                        m). In the center of the unusual structure rests an impressive cone with 30 rows of mirrors
                        that
                        reflect
                        sunlight
                        into the parliamentary hall.
                        In our shoestring trip, I think it will be important to mention that the entrance here is
                        absolutely
                        free.
                        But you
                        need to register in advance.

                    <h3>13. Brandenburg Gate</h3>
                    <p>
                        The famous landmark is the Brandenburg Gate - an example of ancient Greek style architecture.
                        They
                        were
                        built as a
                        connecting element of 2 parts of the city. However, a turn of history made it a symbol of the
                        separation
                        of
                        Berlin
                        and the state (1961), when the Berlin Wall was erected.
                        At the top, there is a classic quadriga with four horses, controlled by the goddess Victoria.
                        During
                        the
                        invasion of
                        Napoleon, the quadriga was taken to Paris as a war trophy (1806) and returned after 8
                        years.

                    <p>
                        A block from the pompous Brandenburg Gate, there is a huge field of grass and lined with gray
                        concrete
                        blocks. On
                        the edge, they are low and scattered, but gradually increase in height and form endless rows
                        with
                        narrow
                        passages.
                        There are no inscriptions anywhere, but an alarming and oppressive aura is felt. Tourists often
                        come
                        here,
                        although
                        the Holocaust Memorial is a sad place, inexplicably awakening in people a sense of endless and
                        senseless
                        tragedy.
                        This is the task set by the author of the project, Peter Eiseman.

                    <h3>15. <span lang="de">Potsdamer Platz</span> (Potsdam Square)</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span lang="de">Potsdamer Platz</span> is the embodiment of the rapidly developing modernity.
                        More recently, this place
                        was
                        a
                        wasteland
                        left after the destruction of the Wall. For 20 years, the cultural and economic center of the
                        German
                        capital
                        was
                        formed on it. Many trade establishments, art institutions, modern office buildings of
                        the
                        21st
                        century
                        adorn the neighborhoods surrounding the square.

                    <h3>16. Sony Center</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most visited objects of <span lang="de">Potsdamer Platz</span> is the Sony Center.
                        This is a complex of
                        buildings
                        built
                        according to the most modern Japanese technologies. For 2 years (1996-98), 7 buildings were
                        built,
                        then
                        for
                        2 years
                        a huge glass dome was mounted above them. The opening of the center, which took place in 2000,
                        was
                        attended
                        by 2.5
                        thousand well-known politicians, public and cultural figures.
                        Everyone was shocked by the scale and originality of modern buildings. Sony Center is an oval
                        square
                        with 7
                        glass
                        and steel buildings located around it. The roof-dome, which unites all the buildings with a
                        tent,
                        symbolizes
                        Fujiyama, sacred to the Japanese. It looks especially irresistible in the evening, illuminated
                        by
                        multi-colored
                        lights that change every 21 seconds.

                        bunkers,
                        signaling devices. Documents tell of numerous defectors, of which 1.5 thousand people died.

                    <h3>19. East Side Gallery</h3>
                    <p>
                        The East Side Gallery Berlin is an original open-air art gallery in Berlin, located directly on
                        a
                        fragment
                        of the
                        Berlin Wall, the length of which is more than 1300 meters.
                        At the end of November 1989, <span lang="de">Manfred Butzmann</span>, a citizen of the GDR,
                        painted hares on a wall in
                        the
                        <span lang="de">Potsdamer Platz</span>
                        area, on the east side, over which someone wrote: "<span lang="de">Die Schande Mauer muss
                            fallen</span>!" (“The wall of
                        shame
                        must
                        fall!”).
                        This act was perceived by the police of the GDR as hostile to the state and the picture was
                        painted.
                        However, the process could no longer be stopped. The Council of Ministers of the GDR decided to
                        invite
                        artists to
                        work specially on wall paintings, paints and brushes were provided free of charge.
                        Since January 1990, 118 artists from 21 countries have painted over 1,316 meters of the Berlin
                        Wall
                        on
                        the
                        east
                        side. The East Side Gallery is considered the longest art gallery in the world.

                        you.</p>
                    <p>

                        to
                        mention

                    <p>I did not mention it above but if you have time, visit <span lang="de">DDR</span> Museum. It’s
                        very interactive (that

                    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
                    <p>
                        As soon as I arrived, I immediately regretted my trip. For some reason, my Internet did not
                        work,
                        the
                        weather was
                        very windy, QR-codes were required everywhere. The first impression was deceiving. I never
                        figured
                        out
                        why
                        the
                        internet wasn't working, but I survived without it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, everywhere there were small stations
                        for
                        rapid
                        tests,
                        which were free. The transport system is the same as they say about it - perfect! My first
                        Couchsurfing
                        experience
                        was very cool, the host turned out to be an interesting and kind person. The last pleasant thing
                        I
                        got
                        from
                        Berlin
                        happened to me on the last day. I was ordering some food at the Vietnamese cafe. They had
                        already
                        prepared
                        it. I was
                        about to pay but it turned out I couldn't pay by card, as they accepted only cash. My cash was
                        only
                        2
                        Euros.
                        They
                        passed me the food, took 2 Euros and told me to go. Thank you, Berlin!</p>
                    <p>I hope you will love Berlin as well. It's a great city with a lot of landmarks, perfect
                        transport
                        system
                        and
                        a lot
                        of Asian food.
